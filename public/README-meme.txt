Place the meme image you provided here as `meme.jpg` so the homepage will display it.

Steps:
1. Save the image file you attached as `meme.jpg`.
2. Copy it into this folder: `c:\VSCODE prg\Hackathon\wame_frontend\public\meme.jpg`.
3. Restart the dev server or refresh the page: http://localhost:3000

If the image is missing the homepage will show a small caption telling you to add it.
